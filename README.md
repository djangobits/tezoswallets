### A simple list of ~~available~~ Tezos wallets

I just wanted to create a list of existing or future Tezos wallets. Do your own due dilligence before trusting any wallet with a private key or other secrets!


### Tezos wallets

Note, that some of these wallets are still not finished and under heavy development and might run on alphanet, zeronet or other non betanet instances (or may not be finished yet).
